WARNING  | 2016-11-22 11:33:44,691 | analysis_m |    Warning as of April 2016: We have noticed that the kmeans algorithm does not perform well on some simulated datasets. We are working on investigating and addressing this but in the mean time we suggest being very cautious about using this algorithm. At the very least, you should try other approaches (e.g. partitioning by locus), and investigate your answers carefully (both the trees and the partitioning schemes). If you have any questions, please get in touch on the google group. Note that this warning does not apply to cases where you are using models that have an ascertainment bias for datasets that include only variable sites as is often the case with morphological analyses.
